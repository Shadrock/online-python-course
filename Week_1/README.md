# Week 1 Content
The focus for the first week is to present a broad understanding of software development, programming, and contextualizing these in the practice of international development. I put a heavy emphasis on being able to accurately and precisely talk about coding and technology. During the first week I also introduce Github, Colab, and make sure that everyone has a working environment.

Other resources introduced this week:
- searching Github repositories for code examples and to see what different organizations are doing for tech. Both [UNICEF](https://github.com/unicef) and [USAID]( https://github.com/USAID/) are examples I use.
- searching and posting to [StackOverflow]( https://stackoverflow.com)

See the `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` folder for code along notebook lectures and the `Lecture_slides` folder for .pdf versions of the PowerPoints I gave (you’ll need to adapt these for yourself since a lot of the international development / humanitarian examples are pulled straight from my professional experience).

**Readings for the week**
- Chapter 1, [The Way of the Program](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2002.html)
- Chapter 2,  [Variables, Expressions, Statements](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2003.html) If the start of the semester is a full week I assign this, otherwise, it goes into next week.

They should also do some reading to familiarize themselves with the “open source” debate in International Development, which will be the focus of a writing assignment next week. These readings could also be used to facilitate a discussion. I start them off with:
- Watch this [TEDx talk featuring Chris Fabian of UNICEF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASNwGNUOiJY)
- Explore [UNICEF’s Innovation group and explore what types of project they do](http://unicefstories.org/tag/open-source/)
- Read contrasting views on open source technology in international development in [this ICTWorks blog post](https://www.ictworks.org/how-can-open-source-software-be-sustainable-in-international-development/#.XLVJJpNKiF0) and [this Devresults blog post]( https://blog.devresults.com/the-revolution-will-not-be-open-source/)

## Lab / Assignment
The first lab is a little different because I start them off with a writing assignment. So there is no lab repo for this week. Writing understandable text about technology, whether for documentation or something else, is a big focus in class. Even if they don’t go on to be professional coders, I want them to be able to speak clearly with coders and about technology. I’ve seen so much jargon-filled nonsense about tech in development that it makes my teeth hurt. The assignment is as follows:

Write a 500 – 1,000 word paper to explain what you think Github is and whether it could be useful in International Development? If you don't know what Github is, do basic desktop research to find out and do your best. Provide footnotes with links or resources that helped you answer these questions. If you already use Github, briefly explain how you've used it and what has been helpful or difficult about learning to use it.

Provide details on formatting and submissions as needed.

**Additional Lab work this week**
Sometimes it’s helpful to meet up and ensure everybody has a working environment: this might mean connecting to shared network drives, having access to University systems like Blackboard or Moodle, or just making sure everybody is signed up for the appropriate services. I make sure I get a list of everyone’s Github accounts, etc.
