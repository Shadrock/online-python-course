# **Analyzing a Survey & Creating Charts in Python**
This folder contains two notebooks that I use as more complex coding assignment towards the end of the semester. The content here could also be used to replace part of the final project, as an exam, or however you see fit.

The `Kenya_Counties_survey` has students process a `.txt` file and deliver a series of outputs while the following `Kenya_Counties_create_charts` introduces [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to produce graphical charts from the survey.
