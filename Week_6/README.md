# Week 6 Content
This week is left open to either cover material that got pushed back and/or to focus on final projects and finishing the more complicated "Analyzing a Survey" assignments.

 I do spend some time in this final week introducing students to resources to continue their practice, how to format and clean up their Github account to act as a bit of a portfolio piece, and ways to connect to the larger Python community. The .pdf lecture included here (`Presentation_13_Resources_future`) came from a period where I was using Github Classroom and lab computers, so it was important to give students instructions for setting up Python at home (if they had exclusively used lab computers) and transferring permissions for their repositories. This year Iâ€™m just doing this all up front with a focus on using Google colab or Anaconda.

There are no further `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` notebook lectures.

**Readings for the week**
- No readings this week: focus on finish final projects and assignments.


## Lab
There is no lab this week to give students extra time to finish their final project.

**Additional Assignments**
I like to introduce some more complex coding assignments towards the end of the semester and have prepared two Notebooks in the "[Analyzing a Survey](https://github.com/Shadrock/online-python-course/tree/master/Analyzing_a_Survey_Assignment)" folder. This week I release the `Kenya_Counties_create_charts` Notebook, which builds on the processing done last week in the `Kenya_Counties_survey`. The notebook this week introduces [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to produce graphical charts.
