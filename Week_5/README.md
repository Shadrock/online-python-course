# Week 5 Content
This wee introduces data structures, with a focus on lists and dictionaries. While lectures and code along sessions focus on slicing, dicing, traversing, and generally manipulating lists and dictionaries I try to spend some time talking about the importance of understanding different data structures for different uses. I also touch on metadata and reinforce earlier talking points about commenting code, creating good file variable names, etc.

See the `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` folder for code along notebook lectures and the `Lecture_slides` folder for .pdf versions of the PowerPoints I gave (you’ll need to adapt these for yourself since a lot of the international development / humanitarian examples are pulled straight from my professional experience). 

**Readings for the week**
- Chapter 9, [Case study: word play](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2010.html). I really focus on the debugging section.
- Chapter 10,  [Lists](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2011.html)
- Chapter 11,  [Dictionaries](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2012.html)

## Lab
This week’s lab using string manipulation to generate outputs in desired formats. The lab builds on the previous lab’s use of web scraping.
