# Week 2 Content
This week kicks of coding in earnest. There is another writing assignment this week, but the lectures contain coding practice and there is a coding lab.

See the `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` folder for code along notebook lectures and the `Lecture_slides` folder for .pdf versions of the PowerPoints I gave (you’ll need to adapt these for yourself since a lot of the international development / humanitarian examples are pulled straight from my professional experience).

**Readings for the week**
- Chapter 3, [Functions](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2004.html)
- Chapter 4,  [Case study: interface design](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2005.html)

## Lab / Assignment
This week contains both a lab (see folder) for coding work and another writing assignment. The writing assignment is as follows:

Write between 1,000 - 1,500 words to discuss open source software in international development and humanitarian settings and / or the role of things like "big data" in development and humanitarian settings. You should also discuss how it might relate to your given field if you are not in IDCE. You should reference readings we have had in class; the additional readings below; and at least two other sources. Specific themes you should address are: what is "open source" and "big data" (how are these things defined); describe benefits, challenges, or both that they create in development or humanitarian settings, as well as your field. There is no right answer here: I want you to process what we've read, find some new material, and offer your thoughts with clear arguments. You should present at least one real or imagined example to illustrate your argument.

Provide details on formatting and submissions as needed.

At a minimum, I ask students to use/cite the following in their paper. The sources below could also be used for a moderated discussion.

**Additional Assignments**
It may be valuable to start off the week by having students take some snippet of code performed during class and submit it via a new Github repository. The instructions for this could be:

In class, we wrote a brief script. Please upload that script to a Github repository in your account; add a brief bit of descriptive text in the "README"; and submit the link.
-  If you need a walk-through in how to create a Github repository: the [Github documentation is here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo).
-  You can change the way the README file in your repository looks by editing the README, which uses "markdown" as a way to change formatting. The [Github documentation for editing your README file is here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository).
-  For help learning how to format text using markdown, see the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), or [this handy site](https://www.makeareadme.com/), which explains the importance of a README file and lets you play with markdown and see what it's doing.
