# Week 6 Content
This week is left open to either cover material that got pushed back and/or to focus on final projects and finishing the more complicated
>>> INTRODUCE KE COUNTIES COLAB.

 I do spend some time in this final week introducing students to resources to continue their practice, how to format and clean up their Github account to act as a bit of a portfolio piece, and ways to connect to the larger Python community. The .pdf lecture included here (`Presentation_13_Resources_future`) came from a period where I was using Github Classroom and lab computers, so it was important to give students instructions for setting up Python at home (if they had exclusively used lab computers) and transferring permissions for their repositories. This year Iâ€™m just doing this all up front with a focus on using Google colab or Anaconda.

There are no further `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` notebook lectures.
