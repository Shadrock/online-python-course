# Week 1 Content
The focus for the first week is to present a broad understanding of software development, programming, and contextualizing these in the practice of international development. I put a heavy emphasis on being able to accurately and precisely talk about coding and technology. During the first week I also introduce Github, Colab, and make sure that everyone has a working environment.

This week also introduces the basics of Python (see readings below) with a focus on variables, expressions, and statements.

Other resources introduced this week:
- searching Github repositories for code examples and to see what different organizations are doing for tech. Both [UNICEF](https://github.com/unicef) and [USAID]( https://github.com/USAID/) are examples I use.
- searching and posting to [StackOverflow]( https://stackoverflow.com)

See the `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` folder for code along notebook lectures and the `Lecture_slides` folder for .pdf versions of the PowerPoints I gave (you’ll need to adapt these for yourself since a lot of the international development / humanitarian examples are pulled straight from my professional experience).

**Readings for the week**
- Chapter 1, [The Way of the Program](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2002.html)
- Chapter 2,  [Variables, Expressions, Statements](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2003.html) If the start of the semester is a full week I assign this, otherwise, it goes into next week.

## Lab / Assignments
This week's lab is using Python to perform calculations of area.

I also like start the class off with a writing assignment. Writing understandable text about technology, whether for documentation or something else, is a big focus in class. Even if they don’t go on to be professional coders, I want them to be able to speak clearly with coders and about technology. I’ve seen so much jargon-filled nonsense about tech in development that it makes my teeth hurt. The assignment is as follows:

Write a 500 – 1,000 word paper to explain what you think Github is and whether it could be useful in International Development? If you don't know what Github is, do basic desktop research to find out and do your best. Provide footnotes with links or resources that helped you answer these questions. If you already use Github, briefly explain how you've used it and what has been helpful or difficult about learning to use it.

Provide details on formatting and submissions as needed.

**Additional Assignments**
Sometimes it’s helpful to meet up and ensure everybody has a working environment: this might mean connecting to shared network drives, having access to University systems like Blackboard or Moodle, or just making sure everybody is signed up for the appropriate services. I make sure I get a list of everyone’s Github accounts, etc.

It may be valuable to start off the week by having students take some snippet of code performed during class and submit it via a new Github repository. The instructions for this could be:
>In class, we wrote a brief script. Please upload that script to a Github repository in your account; add a brief bit of descriptive text in the "README"; and submit the link.

-  If you need a walk-through in how to create a Github repository: the [Github documentation is here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo).
-  You can change the way the README file in your repository looks by editing the README, which uses "markdown" as a way to change formatting. The [Github documentation for editing your README file is here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository).
-  For help learning how to format text using markdown, see the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), or [this handy site](https://www.makeareadme.com/), which explains the importance of a README file and lets you play with markdown and see what it's doing.
