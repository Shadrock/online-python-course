# **Analyzing a Survey & Creating Charts in Python**
This folder contains two notebooks that I use as more complex coding assignment towards the end of the semester. The content here could also be used to replace part of the final project, as an exam, or however you see fit.

The `Kenya_Counties_survey` has students process a `.txt` file and deliver a series of outputs while the following `Kenya_Counties_create_charts` introduces [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to produce graphical charts from the survey.

Each notebook contains instructions *and* solutions: edit them as you see fit for use in your class. I have also created a `README` file for each notebook with the solution code blocks *omitted*. I prefer to release these instructions as `README` files and ask students to submit a new notebook. Depending on now your class is progressing it may be best to use the notebooks as code alongs or as practice.
