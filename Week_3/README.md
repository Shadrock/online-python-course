# Week 3 Content
This week continues building up basic concepts and includes some focus on debugging and understanding errors. I’ve prepared a notebook that contains a lot of common errors along with basic explanations about what they are. This can be done as an in-class exercise, an assignment, or however you see fit.

See the `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` folder for code along notebook lectures and the `Lecture_slides` folder for .pdf versions of the PowerPoints I gave (you’ll need to adapt these for yourself since a lot of the international development / humanitarian examples are pulled straight from my professional experience).

**Readings for the week**
