# Week 4 Content
This week focuses a lot on iteration, especially using `if/else/` and `while` statements. Lab this week introduces students to gathering data by web scraping so I include some discussion and group work about the basics of a web page and how to use developer tools to find the elements that you want to scrape. I also briefly talk about the ethics of web scraping. The goal isn’t to provide a complete course in web scraping, but to really show them the power of advanced Python work and get them excited about using the web in new ways. 

See the `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` folder for code along notebook lectures and the `Lecture_slides` folder for .pdf versions of the PowerPoints I gave (you’ll need to adapt these for yourself since a lot of the international development / humanitarian examples are pulled straight from my professional experience).
