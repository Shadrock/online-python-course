# **Analyzing a Survey & Creating Charts in Python**
This folder contains two notebooks that I use as more complex coding assignment towards the end of the semester. The content here could also be used to replace part of the final project, as an exam, or however you see fit.

The `Kenya_Counties_survey` has students process a `.txt` file and deliver a series of outputs while the following `Kenya_Counties_create_charts` introduces [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to produce graphical charts from the survey.

Each notebook contains instructions *and* solutions so that they act as tutorials. Edit them as you see fit for use in your class. I have also created a `README` file for each notebook with the solution code blocks *omitted*, which are released as instructions that get students started on the code, but then requires them to complete it on their own. These can be released as labs, assignments, etc.
