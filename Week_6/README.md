# Week 6 Content
This week continues with dictionaries and briefly goes over tuples. I do spend some time in this final week introducing students to resources to continue their practice, how to format and clean up their Github account to act as a bit of a portfolio piece, and ways to connect to the larger Python community. One of the .pdf lectures included here (`Presentation_13_Resources_future`) came from a period where I was using Github Classroom and lab computers, so it was important to give students instructions for setting up Python at home (if they had exclusively used lab computers) and transferring permissions for their repositories. This year I’m just doing this all up front with a focus on using Google colab or Anaconda.

See the `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` folder for code along notebook lectures and the `Lecture_slides` folder for .pdf versions of the PowerPoints I gave (you’ll need to adapt these for yourself since a lot of the international development / humanitarian examples are pulled straight from my professional experience).

**Readings for the week**
- Chapter 12, [Tuples](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2013.html)
- Chapter 13, [Case study: data structure selection](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2014.html) – I haven’t lectured on this yet, but realized last year that I needed to include more on data structures. 


## Lab
This week’s lab is about iterating through a dictionary of refugee statistics to create basic outputs.
