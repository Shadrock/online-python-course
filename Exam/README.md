# Exam
The exam is presented here as an `.ipynb` file, but I generally give it as a printed page in person. I want them to hand-write out the answer without looking at a screen. For the online version of the class, I will invert the code sections: instead of asking what a piece of code will do, I’ll describe what I want a piece of code to do, then ask them to create it.  

I generally give the exam in the final week of class. In advance of the exam I explain to students that:

> “Exam material will be pulled largely from script examples we have had in class (or those that are very similar) and the readings. You should be able to look at code that uses all the things we have discussed: functions, various data types, data structures, iteration, etc. and explain what that code would do. You should also be comfortable defining key terms from the lectures and the readings.”
