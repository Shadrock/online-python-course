# Week 5 Content
This week continues with data structures, with a focus on dictionaries. I also touch on tuples, but because they are much less common at this stage of coding, the focus of lectures and code along sessions is slicing, dicing, traversing, and general manipulation techniques with dictionaries.

See the `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` folder for code along notebook lectures and the `Lecture_slides` folder for .pdf versions of the PowerPoints I gave (you’ll need to adapt these for yourself since a lot of the international development / humanitarian examples are pulled straight from my professional experience).

**Readings for the week**
- Chapter 11,  [Dictionaries](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2012.html)
- Chapter 12, [Tuples](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2013.html)
- Chapter 13, [Case study: data structure selection](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2014.html) – I haven’t lectured on this yet, but realized last year that I needed to include more on data structures.

## Lab / Assignments
This week’s lab builds a basic dictionary and traverses it to output some basic, human readable, outputs.
