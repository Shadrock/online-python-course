# Final Project
The final project will require you to complete:
- two Python scripts (including comment codes within the script),
- a short 600 – 800 word write up about both scripts, and
- delivery via a Github repository.

Script 1 will be like a lab: you will receive a script and instructions about how to modify it. Script 2 will be something you develop on your own. You should submit a short (100 – 150 word) description of the script you plan to develop for script 2, which I’ll approve by the next day. Once you’re are approved: start coding!

**Documentation is absolutely critical:** you should have a clear comment block at the top of all scripts with author, date, Python version, input/output information as well as several comments within your code to explain what each part of it does.

## Details on the scripts:
**Script 1:** This will be similar to a lab and you will be given instructions to follow along and modify the script to get a particular result.

**Script 2:** This will be a script you choose to (re)create. If you have a project that you’d like to try or something that you want to try, now is the time to try and write some code for it! Previous students have tried using natural language processing tools to count the occurrences of work in a given body of text.

If you don’t have a particular topic you want to pursue, you can identify one of the previous labs, or choose an exercise presented in the textbook, and re-write the code using what you have learned in class (or perhaps even outside of class) to accomplish a slightly different task. For example, we had a lab to calculate rainwater run-off. You might want to re-write this lab to accept user input for the values required to calculate something else.

If you are completely stuck about the kind of script you want to write: start by going back through the labs and the chapters in the book. Each chapter has an “Exercises” section with problems and code that you could use. Finally, you could try pulling an exercise from https://automatetheboringstuff.com/, which features lots of tutorials on things like working with Excel sheets, changing file names, etc. **Be aware**, however, that some of these will feature libraries that may be problematic for use on lab computers or on Colab. You’ll need to check first to make sure that the libraries can be loaded in your local environment. Colab does come with a pretty big range of libraries already installed so it __should__ be a safe bet for coding.

## Details about the write up:
Your write up should clearly and succinctly describe __both__ scripts.

**Script 1:**, you can explain the purpose of the script, how well it functioned (or if it didn’t), and whether or not you might use something like this in the future.

**Script 2:** clearly explain what the goal of the script is; what inputs are required; what outputs are expected. Ideally, you’d have a real-life scenario in hand (e.g. “by allowing user input for the script to _______, we ensure that it can be easily run without a user needing to program in Python.”). That is only an example but should give you an idea for what I’m looking for. Additionally, you should describe the process of writing the script: was it easy, hard, what challenges or errors did you face and how did you resolve the issue? If you use any resources to help write your code (e.g. Stackoverflow.com; the text book; etc.) then please describe these in the body of the text. E.g. “After repeated syntax errors, I checked Stackoverflow.com to find that…”  Use Markdown to format your text and link to a specific online resources that you used.
Remember: when this project is complete, we can transfer ownership of this repo to you so it will appear in your Github account and be something you can use to demonstrate your technical ability coming out of this class: so make this count!

## Important Dates / Steps
Your write up should clearly and succinctly
- _INSTRUCTOR TO CHOOSE DATE AS APPROPRIATE_: Submit your 100 – 150 word proposal about what you will do for script 2.
- _INSTRUCTOR TO CHOOSE DATE AS APPROPRIATE_: your code must be delivered.
