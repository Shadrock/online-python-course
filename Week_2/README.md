# Week 2 Content
This week kicks of coding in earnest by diving into functions, conditionals, and recursion. There is another writing assignment this week designed to get them thinking about what "open source" means and when it might be useful.

See the `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` folder for code along notebook lectures and the `Lecture_slides` folder for .pdf versions of the PowerPoints I gave (you’ll need to adapt these for yourself since a lot of the international development / humanitarian examples are pulled straight from my professional experience).

**Readings for the week**
- Chapter 3, [Functions](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2004.html)
- Chapter 4,  [Case study: interface design](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2005.html)
- Chapter 5, [Conditionals & Recursions](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2006.html)

They should also do some reading to familiarize themselves with the “open source” debate in International Development, which will be the focus of a writing assignment next week. These readings could also be used to facilitate a discussion. I start them off with:
- Watch this [TEDx talk featuring Chris Fabian of UNICEF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASNwGNUOiJY)
- Explore [UNICEF’s Innovation group and explore what types of project they do](http://unicefstories.org/tag/open-source/)
- Read contrasting views on open source technology in international development in [this ICTWorks blog post](https://www.ictworks.org/how-can-open-source-software-be-sustainable-in-international-development/#.XLVJJpNKiF0) and [this Devresults blog post]( https://blog.devresults.com/the-revolution-will-not-be-open-source/)

## Lab / Assignments
The lab this week uses `if/elif/else` to classify data. There is also another writing assignment, as follows:

>Write between 1,000 - 1,500 words to discuss open source software in international development and humanitarian settings and / or the role of things like "big data" in development and humanitarian settings. You should also discuss how it might relate to your given field. You should reference readings we have had in class; the additional readings below; and at least two other sources. Specific themes you should address are: what is "open source" and "big data" (how are these things defined); describe benefits, challenges, or both that they create in development or humanitarian settings, as well as your field. There is no right answer here: I want you to process what we've read, find some new material, and offer your thoughts with clear arguments. You should present at least one real or imagined example to illustrate your argument.

Provide details on formatting and submissions as needed.

At a minimum, I ask students to use/cite the following in their paper. The sources below could also be used for a moderated discussion.
