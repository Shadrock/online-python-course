# Week 3 Content
This week continues building up basic concepts and includes some focus on incremental development, debugging and understanding errors. I’ve prepared a notebook that contains a lot of common errors along with basic explanations about what they are. This can be done as an in-class exercise, an assignment, or however you see fit.

We also introduce the concept of iteration, especially using `if/else/elif` and `while` statements. Lab this week introduces students to gathering data by web scraping so I include some discussion and group work about the basics of a web page and how to use developer tools to find the elements that you want to scrape. I also briefly talk about the ethics of web scraping. The goal isn’t to provide a complete course in web scraping, but to really show them the power of advanced Python work and get them excited about using the web in new ways.

See the `Lecture_jupyter_notebooks` folder for code along notebook lectures and the `Lecture_slides` folder for .pdf versions of the PowerPoints I gave (you’ll need to adapt these for yourself since a lot of the international development / humanitarian examples are pulled straight from my professional experience).

## Lab
Lab this week introduces students to gathering data by web scraping. They are given a completed script and need to adjust aspects of it to achieve specific outputs.
